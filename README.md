# Voice-Recognition-System

This program is supposed to run on ubunto.

In order to run the program, open terminal in ubunto and go to the project folder where the files are stored, then type these words:
* gcc Record.c libportaudio.a –lm –lrt –lasound –pthread –o FileName.out

After the FileName.out is built, type:
* ./FileName.out

Note that the program works best if the input volume is set on half.
